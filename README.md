## ABOUT
[ELN](http://electrical-age.net/) is a Minecraft Mod offering the ability to perform large-scale, in-game electrical simulations. Here is some highlighted features:

A better simulation
> Electrical simulation with resistive and capacitive effects. Behaviour similar to those of real life objects.
	
Multiple electrical machines and components
> Furnaces, Solar panels, Wind turbines, Batteries, Capacitors, ...
	
Break the cube
> Cables, sensors, actuators, alarms, etc. can be placed on each face (outer and inner) of a cube, which allows a significant reduction of the consumed space by electrical installations.
	
Night-lighting revisited
> Lamps, switches, captors, ...
	
Small and big electrical consumers
> From lamps and electrical furnaces to miners and transporters...

Incredible tools
> XRay scanner, flashlight, portable mining drill...

Interoperability
> Old redstone circuits can be exploited with electrical <-> redstone converters.
	
Game lifetime/complexity extended
> A consequent list of new raw materials and items...

## CURRENT STATE
