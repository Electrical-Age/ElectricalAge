Minecraft Mod - Codename : ELN
==============================

## ABOUT
[ELN](https://github.com/Dolu1990/eln) is a Minecraft Mod offering the ability to perform large-scale in-game electrical simulations. Here is some highlighted features:

::A better simulation::

  Electrical simulation with resistive and capacitive effects. Behaviour similar to those of real life objects.
	
::Multiple electrical sources::

  Furnaces, Solar panels, Wind turbines, Batteries, Capacitors, ...
	
::Break the cube::

  Cables, sensors, actuators, alarms, etc. can be placed on each face (outer and inner) of a cube, witch allows a significant reduction of the consumed space by electrical installations.
	
::Night-lighting revisited::

  Lamps, switches, captors, ...
	
::Small and big electricals consumers :

  From the lamps, electrical furnaces,... to the miners, transporters, ...
	
::Genericity::

  Old redstones circuits can be exploited with electrical<->redstones converters.
	
::Game lifetime/complexity extended::

  A consequent list of new raw materials and items...

Actual state : Alpha
